# HackHers-Bootcamp

Welcome to our Bootcamp Project! This website is dedicated to showcasing the upcoming event, Industry Night. It provides event details, program information, and insights into the Interactive Media Design (IDP) program.

Our primary goal with this project is to effectively convey information about the event, and the IDP program, and to present student portfolios. We've utilized HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to create an informative and engaging web platform.
